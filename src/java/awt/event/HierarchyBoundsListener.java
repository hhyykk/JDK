/**
 * The listener interface for receiving ancestor moved and resized events.
 * The class that is interested in processing these events either implements
 * this interface (and all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract
 * <code>HierarchyBoundsAdapter</code> class (overriding only the method of
 * interest).
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * Component using the Component's <code>addHierarchyBoundsListener</code> 
 * method. When the hierarchy to which the Component belongs changes by
 * the resizing or movement of an ancestor, the relevant method in the listener
 * object is invoked, and the <code>HierarchyEvent</code> is passed to it.
 * <p>
 * Hierarchy events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;
 * The AWT will automatically handle changes to the hierarchy internally so
 * that GUI layout works properly regardless of whether a
 * program registers an <code>HierarchyBoundsListener</code> or not.
